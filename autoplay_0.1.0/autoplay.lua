Work with subgoals.

MVP/PoC: Research automation.
Check production so far, and check production over time (10 seconds or so)
Calculate time required to complete.
Calculate how many machines to build to minimize time required.

Example:
- 10 science packs      55 seconds raw. 20 iron, 10 copper.
- 1 lab                 22 seconds raw. 36 iron, 15 copper.
- 1 steam engine        7 seconds raw. 31 iron.
- 1 boiler              3 seconds raw. 4 iron. 5 stone.
TOTAL: 91 iron. 25 copper. 5 stone.


- 1 electric pole (maybe skip calculating poles, as it is nothing compared to the rest)
