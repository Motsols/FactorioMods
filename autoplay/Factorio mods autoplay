Implementation:

- https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Reserved
- create ghost entities
- write text on map?

LuaGameScript
- show_message_dialog

Skip the walking things in MVP. Create ghost entities and stuff instead, and use alerts.
/c game.player.walking_state = { walking = true, direction = defines.direction.northeast }

Instantly: /c game.player.mine_entity(game.player.selected)
/c game.player.print(game.entity_prototypes["iron-ore"].mineable_properties.mining_time)

CONCRETE for marking
/c game.player.surface.set_tiles({ { name = "tutorial-grid", position = { 0, 0 } }, { name = "orange-refined-concrete", position = { 5, 0 } }, { name = "green-refined-concrete", position = { 10, 0 } } })
orange, purple, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, cyan
- overwrites water, works on cliffs.



LuaForce:
- chart, chart_all, is_chunk_charted, is_chunk_visible
- print with color
- game.player.force.add_chart_tag(game.player.surface, { text = "Hello World", position = { 0, 0 }, last_user = game.player })
- game.player.force.add_chart_tag(game.player.surface, { text = "Hello World", icon = { type = "fluid", name = "water" }, position = { 0, 0 }, last_user = game.player })
- game.player.force.add_research("automation")
- inform on research complete?
- get_train_stops
- ai_controllable (current usage?)

LuaPlayer:
- /c game.player.add_alert(game.player.selected, defines.alert_type.no_storage)
- /c game.player.add_custom_alert(game.player.selected, { type = "fluid", name = "water" }, "Hello", true)
- /c game.player.set_goal_description("Some text", false)
- game.player.create_local_flying_text({ text = "Hello", position = game.player.position })
- game.player.create_local_flying_text({ text = "Hello", position = game.player.position, color = { r = 0, g = 1, b = 1 }, time_to_live = 500, speed = 0.3 })
- game.player.zoom_to_world(game.player.position, 0.9)
- game.player.open_map(game.player.position, 0.05)
- game.player.close_map()
- afk_time
- spectator?
- zoom (write), map_view_settings (write)


LuaSurface:
- create_entity


Notes:
- Cliffs, trees and rocks are entities




Chunk designations

Each chunk is 32x32
Subdivide into 4x4 or 2x2 (per chunk: 8x8 = 64 or 16x16 = 256)

orange, purple, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, cyan
MILITARY - Edges of my control area
POWER - Steam, Solar, Accumulators, other (Krastorio 2 has a few options)
FARMING - Recipe that only requires some infinite resources
SMELTING
PATH - For moving around on the map faster
TRAINS - For moving around on the map faster, and for item transports
TRAIN_STATION - For loading or unloading (preferably not both as that causes issues)
REFINING / OIL_PROCESSING
MINING - For areas with resources
RESEARCH
MALL_AREA - stuff produced and ready to be taken / delivered by bots

Keep track of what small things goes where (belts and pipes, underground or not)
